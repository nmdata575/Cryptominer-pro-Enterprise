<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory for CryptoMiner Pro V30 demonstrates an advanced, iterative development process, addressing complex challenges across software layers and environment setup. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes, particularly for the Scrypt mining protocol and persistent environmental issues like Python versioning, port conflicts, and MongoDB connectivity. Subsequently, enterprise-grade features were added, including distributed mining capabilities, licensing, and remote node management. The engineer then implemented user-requested enhancements like saved pool configurations and custom coin management, followed by significant refactoring for file consolidation and the creation of an uninstall script. Throughout, the process highlighted a strong focus on debugging, environment hardening, and responsive feature development, culminating in a robust, functional, and organized application, despite recurring system-level configuration challenges related to Ubuntu versions and Python dependencies.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro application began as a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining platform for individuals and enterprises, requiring real-time metrics, AI for hash prediction and coin switching, and configurable Scrypt-based solo/pool mining. Initial enhancements included wallet integration, performance optimization, Ubuntu 24+ installation support, custom pool/RPC, dynamic CPU adjustment, and a role-based frontend, aiming for a consolidated codebase of 20 essential files.

The project evolved into CryptoMiner Enterprise V30, a distributed mining platform. Core requirements included:
- Scaling CPU utilization to 100% and supporting 250,000+ CPU cores, especially for data centers and GPU farms.
- Centralized database on a separate server.
- Aggregation of remote systems' mining rates and core counts.
- Full GPU utilization for AMD and NVIDIA simultaneously.
- Minimum hardware requirements: 64GB RAM (512GB recommended), 32 cores, 1Gbps network.
- A mandatory license key system (5000 pre-determined 42-character alphanumeric keys).
- A custom communication protocol for central server-to-node communication.
- A terminal-only remote application for nodes, with automatic updates.
- A critical fix for the Scrypt mining protocol to ensure proper share submission to mining pools, compatible with .

Recent user-requested features include storing and reusing previously used pool information (wallet address, password, pool address, port) and adding a custom coin feature for user-defined cryptocurrencies. The latest request involves creating an uninstall script, re-evaluating and condensing existing files for efficiency, verifying dependencies, and preparing for executable packaging.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive codebase overhaul. The work was initiated by the user's request to:
1.  **Add an uninstall script**: This was successfully implemented ().
2.  **Condense files to maintain efficiency**: Significant progress was made on this front.
    *   Installation scripts (, , , ) were consolidated into a single  script, later complemented by a user-facing .
    *   Backend enterprise-related modules (, , , ) were successfully merged into a new  file, and  was updated to use this consolidated module.
    *   Frontend components (, ) were consolidated into a new , and  was updated accordingly.
    *   Redundant test/temporary files were removed.
    *   The  was updated to reflect the consolidated structure.

During this consolidation and environment hardening process, several critical environment-related issues arose and were addressed:
*   **MongoDB installation issues**: Resolved by updating  with correct GPG key handling, Ubuntu 24.04 compatibility, fallback methods (snap, Docker), and creating  and .
*   **Python virtual environment creation errors**: Fixed by enhancing 's  creation logic, adding error handling, and creating .
*   **Incorrect installation path in scripts**: The  and other scripts were updated to dynamically detect the actual installation directory (e.g., ) from supervisor configuration, replacing hardcoded . A  script was created for immediate resolution.
*   **Pandas/Python 3.13 compilation errors**: This led to the decision to standardize on Python 3.12. The  script was updated to automatically install Python 3.12 (from standard Ubuntu 24.04 repos) and use it for the virtual environment, avoiding known  compilation issues.  was created.
*   **Ubuntu Plucky (25.04 development) PPA errors**: The  was further refined to detect development Ubuntu versions, avoid broken PPAs, and use standard repositories or fallbacks for Python installation. A  was created.
*   **Pip dependency conflicts (/)**:  was adjusted, and  and  were created to implement a robust, ordered installation strategy.
*   **Critical system Python corruption ()**: This was a severe system-level issue, leading to the user wiping their system and installing Ubuntu 24.04.
*   **Database connection issues (after system wipe)**: Diagnosed as a  in the backend. This was caused by the  package missing from the virtual environment due to previous installation complexities or restarts. The most recent focus was on fixing this  package issue, exacerbated by the path mismatch between supervisor configuration and the actual file location and
