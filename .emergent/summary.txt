The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative, problem-solving approach to stabilize and enhance the CryptoMiner Pro V30 application. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical regressions: persistent database disconnection, 0.00 H/s mining, and a frozen thread manager. The engineer systematically diagnosed these, often finding root causes in infrastructure (e.g., MongoDB not running, port conflicts, incorrect frontend URL, CORS issues). Frontend React warnings and backend 404 errors were also meticulously cleaned. A significant pivot involved re-evaluating the mining strategy from Litecoin to more CPU-friendly Monero, requiring new mining engine integration. The work then shifted to auditing and refining installation scripts, demonstrating a commitment to a polished, production-ready system. The process highlights a robust debugging methodology, including log analysis, process management, and API testing, leading to successful resolution of complex, interconnected issues.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro application, initially a web-controlled Scrypt mining platform, evolved into CryptoMiner Enterprise V30, a distributed mining solution. Key requirements include scaling to 250,000+ CPU cores, centralized database support, aggregation of remote mining rates, full GPU utilization (AMD/NVIDIA), and specific hardware minimums (64GB RAM, 32 cores, 1Gbps network). Essential features comprise a mandatory license key system, custom central server-to-node communication, a terminal-only remote application with auto-updates, and a critical fix for the Scrypt mining protocol to ensure proper share submission (cgminer compatible). Recent user requests extended to storing pool information, adding custom coin functionality, creating a comprehensive uninstall script, condensing existing files, verifying dependencies, and preparing the application for executable packaging. The goal is a robust, enterprise-grade, and user-friendly mining platform.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive audit and improvement of the application's installation and uninstallation scripts. The user explicitly requested to verify that  and  are capable of:
1.  Properly installing all required dependencies.
2.  Installing all necessary programs.
3.  Installing the main application under the specified  path.
4.  Setting up proper security and user accounts for the MongoDB database.

The engineer had just started this audit by reviewing the  file (Chat Message 790) and was planning to create a comprehensive verification audit and improved installation script (Chat Message 791). This task aims to ensure the application's deployability and maintainability by thoroughly validating the setup process, which is critical for future updates and fixes.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue auditing and improving  and  to meet installation, path, security, and user account requirements for the database.
