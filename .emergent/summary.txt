The previous AI engineer successfully evolved CryptoMiner Pro V30 into V21, a multi-algorithm CPU miner with web monitoring and AI optimization. Initially, the focus was on refactoring to a terminal-based RandomX miner, improving the web dashboard, and integrating an AI optimizer. Recurring issues stemmed from environmental discrepancies (AI engineer in , user on desktop), leading to persistent configuration and database path errors. Key problems included a simulated RandomX miner, hardcoded LTC pool references, incorrect  usage for RandomX,  type comparison bugs, and an API data corruption bug for auto thread values. The AI engineer systematically addressed these, consolidated the codebase to 10 files, re-implemented the web dashboard, and changed its port. Currently, the system in the container is mostly functional, including an offline mining mode fallback. However, the core challenge remains a failure to establish a Stratum protocol handshake with *any* XMR pool, despite network connectivity tests succeeding. The immediate blocking issue is a  in a diagnostic script.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner V21 is envisioned as an enterprise-scale, distributed CPU mining platform supporting Scrypt and Monero (RandomX) algorithms. Core features include license key support, custom server-to-node communication, centralized database aggregation, and a simplified terminal-based miner with optional web monitoring.
Key functional requirements:
- Storage of pool/coin information.
- Robust installation and 1-second control page updates.
- Mining intensity control (0-100%) and AI learning/optimization display.
- CPU mining for Monero (RandomX) with an AI-adaptable algorithm and predictive share submission.
- Webpage algorithm selection box and an AI database up to 15GB.
The goal is a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly CPU mining solution with an intelligent, functional web monitoring dashboard, supporting individual use with a localhost backend. Previous work addressed thread count, high share rejection, authorization, difficulty adjustments, connection timeouts, and graceful termination. Recent fixes focused on making RandomX mining real, fixing configuration overrides, and re-establishing the web UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was diagnosing a critical issue reported by the user: the mining program was not establishing a successful Stratum handshake with *any* Monero mining pool, consistently timing out and falling back to offline mining mode, despite general network connectivity to these pools. This was occurring on the user's desktop environment () after numerous previous fixes related to configuration loading, hardcoded pool references,  flags,  comparison errors, API data corruption, and the web dashboard re-implementation and port change.

The AI engineer initiated a Deep Dive Analysis - Monero Pool Protocol Issues to investigate the Stratum protocol implementation. Network connectivity tests to various XMR pools (, , , ) from the *container environment* successfully confirmed that these pools are reachable. This indicates the issue is not a general network block, but specifically within the application's Stratum protocol handling.

The very last action was an attempt to run a Python script for a manual Stratum handshake test, which resulted in a  on line 119 of the script, effectively halting further debugging of the Stratum issue.
