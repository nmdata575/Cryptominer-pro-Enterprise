<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the CryptoMiner Pro V30 from a complex, supervisor-managed full-stack application into a streamlined, terminal-based mining program with optional web monitoring. Key initial efforts focused on stabilizing the original architecture, resolving installation/uninstallation script issues, MongoDB security, supervisor conflicts, and frontend data lag. The core achievement was the architectural refactor, consolidating  and  into a unified , removing old frontend/backend structures. Subsequent work involved implementing user-requested features like password and mining intensity controls, resolving persistent issues with thread management, share submission failures (Bad file descriptor), and pool authorization. Significant performance gains were achieved by replacing the custom Scrypt implementation with a much faster  library. The engineer also debugged and corrected difficulty adjustment mechanisms and connection timeouts. The current outstanding issue, observed after extensive feature integration and testing, is related to the application's graceful shutdown upon , suggesting unhandled processes or resource cleanup.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro V30 is designed as an enterprise-scale distributed mining platform, targeting 250,000+ CPU cores, with centralized database support and remote mining rate aggregation. Core requirements included full GPU utilization (later pivoted to CPU-friendly Monero/RandomX via Scrypt for initial implementation), substantial hardware support, a mandatory license key system, and custom server-to-node communication.

Recent development phases focused on improving deployability and user experience:
*   Storing pool information and custom coin functionality.
*   Developing robust installation () and uninstallation () scripts, ensuring proper dependency installation, deployment to , and secure MongoDB setup.
*   Improving the control page's update interval from 5 minutes to 1 second.
*   The most significant recent change was the architectural shift to a simplified, terminal-based mining application with optional web monitoring for streamlined operation and debugging.
*   Recent feature additions include:
    *   Adding a  option for mining pools.
    *   Implementing a  (0-100%) control to manage CPU usage.
    *   Displaying AI learning and optimization percentages on the web interface.
*   Ongoing issues to address include:
    *   Ensuring the number of threads changes correctly.
    *   Resolving issues where shares are submitted but not accepted by pools.
    *   Fixing authorization errors related to the password field.
    *   Correcting pool difficulty adjustment, especially when manually set outside specific ranges.
    *   Increasing connection timeouts for pools.
    *   Addressing application termination behavior upon .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical operational issues reported by the user regarding the CryptoMiner Pro V30 application. The application had undergone a major refactor from a full-stack, supervisor-managed system to a single, consolidated  terminal application with a web monitoring interface.

The specific issues being addressed were:
1.  **Password Field Authorization Errors**: The user reported that using the  field resulted in authorization errors with mining pools. The engineer identified that the  in  needed to correctly pass the password during the  call. This was fixed by modifying the 's  and  to correctly send and process authentication details, specifically ensuring the username and password are part of the  request.
2.  **Pool Difficulty Not Adjusting / Rejected Shares**: The user noted that the program wasn't reading the pool difficulty correctly, leading to hundreds of rejected shares due to low difficulty, and the difficulty would revert to 1 for certain ranges (e.g., 2400 or less, 750000 or more).
    *   The engineer implemented a more accurate difficulty calculation based on the Bitcoin Wiki in  to ensure proper target derivation.
    *   Further debugging revealed that pools might have hardcoded difficulty limits. The engineer added logging to show the requested difficulty versus the pool's accepted difficulty.
    *   To improve the chance of connecting with higher starting difficulties, the connection timeout in  was increased from 10 seconds to 120 seconds.
    *   The Stratum protocol's  method was properly utilized to communicate the desired difficulty to the pool, ensuring the miner respects the pool's acceptable range.
    *   The  was updated with testing scenarios for different difficulty ranges, confirming the pool's limitations.

The last message from the user indicates a new problem: when pressing ctrl+c to close the application, this comes up after running for a while, suggesting a graceful shutdown issue. The previous engineer had just finished fixing the difficulty adjustment and connection timeout issues and the user confirmed it's working (Chat Message 741).
