The AI engineer's work on CryptoMiner Pro V30 progressed through distinct phases: initially, stabilizing and refining the existing full-stack application. This involved extensive debugging of installation/uninstallation scripts, resolving MongoDB security, supervisor configuration conflicts, path inconsistencies, and optimizing frontend performance by fixing a 5-minute data lag. The focus then shifted to addressing specific runtime errors, including a  undefined issue in saved pools, webpack build failures, and missing  arguments during mining startup. Resource contention and intermittent MongoDB disconnections under load were also tackled with caching and robust database handling. Crucially, the final phase involved a significant architectural pivot from the complex supervisor-managed full-stack app to a simplified, terminal-based mining application with optional web monitoring, streamlining operations and resolving persistent environmental issues. The current work is centered on consolidating and cleaning the codebase after this conversion.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro V30 application aims to be an enterprise-scale distributed mining platform supporting 250,000+ CPU cores, centralized database support, and remote mining rate aggregation. Initial core requirements included full GPU utilization (AMD/NVIDIA), substantial hardware, a mandatory license key system, and custom central server-to-node communication. A critical protocol fix transitioned from Scrypt to Monero (RandomX) for CPU friendliness.

Recent iterations focused on deployability and user experience, encompassing:
*   Storing pool information and adding custom coin functionality.
*   Developing a comprehensive, robust uninstall script.
*   Condensing existing files and verifying all dependencies.
*   Preparing for executable packaging.
*   Ensuring  and  properly install all dependencies and programs, deploy to , and correctly set up MongoDB security and user accounts.
*   Speeding up the control page's update interval from 5 minutes to 1 second.
*   The most recent major shift involved moving to a terminal-based mining application with web monitoring for simplified operation and debugging.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a significant architectural refactor. The previous full-stack, supervisor-managed application was successfully converted into a simpler, more robust terminal-based mining program with optional web monitoring. This conversion involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new main Python script () that acts as the core terminal mining application, leveraging existing backend logic (, , etc.). It supports command-line arguments for configuration (coin, wallet, pool, threads) and includes an interactive setup mode.
2.  **Developing **: A lightweight web server () designed to provide a minimal monitoring dashboard, intended to run alongside  via WebSockets for real-time updates without requiring a full React frontend or a database.
3.  **Refining Imports and Initialization**: Debugged and corrected various import statements and class initializations within  to correctly integrate the existing backend modules (e.g.,  vs ,  vs ).
4.  **Creating Helper Scripts and Documentation**: Introduced  for easy startup,  for sample configurations, , and  to document the new architecture.

The current activity is the subsequent **cleanup and condensation** of this newly converted system, as per the user's explicit request (cleanup the unnecessary files and condense the terminal program, update the readme.md and any other documentation). Specifically, the engineer has:
*   Removed old service-based files and directories (, , , , supervisor configs).
*   Consolidated  and  into a single, unified  executable.
*   Created  for the new streamlined configuration.
*   Started updating the main  and  files to reflect the new, simplified architecture.
