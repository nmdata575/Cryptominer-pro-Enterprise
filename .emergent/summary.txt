The AI engineer's trajectory for CryptoMiner Pro V30 demonstrates a comprehensive and iterative development approach. Initially, the focus was on consolidating the extensive codebase, merging backend components into , frontend modules into , and simplifying numerous installation scripts into  and . This phase aimed to streamline the application's architecture.

Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to resolving critical environmental and runtime issues, including Python versioning (standardizing on 3.12), MongoDB connectivity (implementing a robust  with connection pooling and auto-reconnection), pip dependency conflicts, and general script robustness. A major task involved fixing the core Scrypt mining protocol, ensuring real share submission, and addressing issues like premature thread termination and accurate statistics reporting. Frontend React warnings and function declaration order were also meticulously fixed.

Despite achieving 100% success in multiple testing phases, the development was characterized by recurring issues, particularly related to database connectivity and mining functionality. The engineer systematically diagnosed and fixed these, often leveraging a troubleshooting agent. The frontend consistently displayed a white screen, identified as an external Kubernetes ingress routing problem rather than an application code defect. The trajectory concludes with a re-emergence of the database and mining non-functionality, indicating the need for further debugging and stability enhancements.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro application began as a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining platform for individuals and enterprises, requiring real-time metrics, AI for hash prediction and coin switching, and configurable Scrypt-based solo/pool mining. Initial enhancements included wallet integration, performance optimization, Ubuntu 24+ installation support, custom pool/RPC, dynamic CPU adjustment, and a role-based frontend, aiming for a consolidated codebase of 20 essential files.

The project evolved into CryptoMiner Enterprise V30, a distributed mining platform. Core requirements included: scaling CPU utilization to 100% and supporting 250,000+ CPU cores, especially for data centers and GPU farms; centralized database on a separate server; aggregation of remote systems' mining rates and core counts; full GPU utilization for AMD and NVIDIA simultaneously; minimum hardware requirements (64GB RAM, 32 cores, 1Gbps network); a mandatory license key system; a custom communication protocol for central server-to-node communication; a terminal-only remote application for nodes with automatic updates; and a critical fix for the Scrypt mining protocol to ensure proper share submission to mining pools, compatible with . Recent user-requested features included storing and reusing previously used pool information and adding a custom coin feature. The latest request involved creating an uninstall script, re-evaluating and condensing existing files for efficiency, verifying dependencies, and preparing for executable packaging.

<pending_tasks>
The most recent explicit pending tasks, as reported by the user and acknowledged by the AI engineer, are:
-   Diagnose and fix the Disconnected database status in the frontend.
-   Diagnose and fix the Mining Not Working (0.00 H/s hash rate) issue.
-   Diagnose and fix the Thread Manager Stuck (Analyzing system capabilities...) display issue.
-   Address the recurring database connection instability and crashes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was confronted with a regression of critical functionalities, despite previous successful fixes and comprehensive testing rounds. The user reported that the application was showing:

1.  **Disconnected Database Status**: On the frontend  panel, the MongoDB connection status appeared as Disconnected or Error, directly contradicting the recently implemented  and the 100% success rate reported by API health checks. This implies an issue with the frontend's interpretation of backend status, or a re-emergent backend connectivity problem under specific conditions.
2.  **Mining Not Working**: The  indicated ACTIVE mining with threads running, but the hash rate displayed 0.00 H/s. This signifies that actual cryptocurrency mining is not occurring, or its statistics are not being correctly updated/displayed, despite previous fixes for JSON parsing, configuration application, and statistics synchronization that had verified real mining and share acceptance.
3.  **Thread Manager Stuck**: The  component showed Analyzing system capabilities... and appeared to be frozen, indicating a potential issue with its initialization, data fetching, or a JavaScript error preventing its proper operation.
4.  **Connection Instability**: The user explicitly stated that the database connection drops short afterwards when it does run, which points to a re-emerging stability issue with the MongoDB connection, previously addressed by the 's pooling and auto-reconnection features.

The AI engineer's current work involves systematically diagnosing these re-emerged problems, acknowledging their critical nature, and planning to identify the root causes to provide stable, lasting fixes.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step will be to systematically diagnose the re-emerged database disconnection, mining non-functionality, and frozen thread manager issues, including checking logs and verifying API endpoints.
