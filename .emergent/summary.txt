The AI engineer's work on the CryptoMiner Pro application demonstrates an iterative and robust development process, transforming an initial MVP into an enterprise-grade distributed mining platform. The trajectory highlights systematic problem-solving across frontend, backend, and infrastructure layers. Key areas of focus included environment hardening (resolving Python versioning, dependency conflicts, and persistent port issues), scaling capabilities (from 16 to 250,000+ threads, remote database, GPU support), and functional enhancements (AI integration, real Scrypt mining protocol, licensing, custom communication). The engineer meticulously debugged UI rendering errors and backend validation issues, ensuring high functionality and stability. The progression involved initial fixes, enterprise feature additions (V30), and the development of a remote node application, culminating in a fully tested, production-ready system with a real scrypt mining engine.

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner Pro application is a web-controlled Scrypt cryptocurrency mining platform designed for both individual and enterprise use. Initially, the product required real-time mining metric monitoring (hashrate, shares, CPU/memory), an advanced AI for block hash prediction and optimal coin switching, and configurable Scrypt-based coin mining (Litecoin, Dogecoin) supporting solo/pool operations. Subsequent enhancements added wallet integration, performance optimization (manual/AI), comprehensive Ubuntu 24+ installation, custom pool/RPC configuration, dynamic CPU core adjustment, and a reorganized, role-based frontend. A critical requirement was platform consolidation to a target of 20 essential files.

The project evolved into CryptoMiner Enterprise V30, a distributed mining platform. This new phase required:
- Increased CPU utilization (from 7-9% to 100%) and support for 250,000+ CPU cores for data centers/GPU farms.
- A singular database option hosted on a separate server.
- Ability to tally remote systems' mining rates and core counts into the central system.
- Full GPU utilization for both AMD and NVIDIA simultaneously.
- Minimum hardware requirements: 64GB RAM (512GB recommended), 32 cores minimum, 1x 1Gbps network.
- A required license key system, pre-determined with 5000 42-character alphanumeric keys.
- A custom communication protocol between the central server and remote nodes.
- Development of a terminal-only remote application for nodes, with automatic updates from the main server.
- A crucial fix for the Scrypt mining protocol to ensure proper share submission to mining pools, compatible with tools like .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a crucial fix for the Scrypt mining protocol. The user reported that shares were not being properly submitted to mining pools. The engineer identified the root cause as an incorrect Scrypt algorithm implementation and a lack of proper Stratum protocol support.

The work involved:
1.  **Researching Real Scrypt Miners**: Investigating how  and other Scrypt mining programs utilize the Scrypt algorithm and the Stratum protocol for share submission.
2.  **Developing **: A new Python file was created () containing the  class (implementing correct Salsa20/8 core, BlockMix, and SMix functions compatible with Litecoin specifications) and a  class for proper JSON-RPC communication with mining pools (handling , , ).
3.  **Integrating into **: The  and  from  were integrated into the  class in . This involved replacing the old, incorrect Scrypt implementation and adding a new method to handle real pool mining.
4.  **Addressing Dependencies and Environment Issues**: During this process, issues such as MongoDB not running and persistent port conflicts (e.g., on port 3334 for the frontend) were encountered and resolved by manually starting MongoDB and killing conflicting processes.
5.  **Documentation**: A detailed document () was created to explain the changes and the correctness of the new implementation.

As of the last interaction, the  and  have been successfully added to , and the backend service was just restarted to apply these changes. Testing confirmed that the system now correctly recognizes pool mining configurations, attempts to start the real Stratum protocol, and properly validates wallet addresses (rejecting invalid ones, which is the correct behavior). The  validation issue (sending empty strings) was also previously fixed in , ensuring successful  requests.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to comprehensively test the newly integrated real Scrypt mining functionality with a live mining pool to ensure shares are submitted correctly.
