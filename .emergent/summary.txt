The AI engineer successfully transformed CryptoMiner Pro V30 into V21, a multi-algorithm CPU miner with web monitoring and AI optimization. The initial phase focused on refactoring to a terminal-based RandomX miner, enhancing the web dashboard, and integrating an AI optimizer. Persistent issues included environmental discrepancies, hardcoded configurations, and  type bugs, all systematically addressed. A critical  in a diagnostic script was bypassed by direct miner execution, revealing a Stratum handshake failed issue. The engineer meticulously fixed the Stratum protocol for Monero, implemented real-time web monitoring, and ensured configuration consistency via . After resolving network reachability with  by switching to , the system achieved stable mining with a functional dashboard displaying real-time accepted/rejected shares. The work concludes with a recurring Unauthenticated error during share submission, pointing to an ongoing authentication or wallet format mismatch with .

<product_requirements>
The CryptoMiner V21 is designed as an enterprise-scale, distributed CPU mining platform for Scrypt and Monero (RandomX) algorithms. It must support license keys, custom server-to-node communication, and centralized database aggregation. The core is a terminal-based miner with optional web monitoring. Key features include storage of pool/coin information, robust installation, and 1-second control page updates. Users need control over mining intensity (0-100%) and display of AI learning/optimization. The system must implement CPU mining for Monero (RandomX) with an AI-adaptable algorithm and predictive share submission, offer webpage algorithm selection, and utilize an AI database up to 15GB. The goal is a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly CPU mining solution with an intelligent, functional web monitoring dashboard, supporting individual use with a localhost backend. Previous work addressed thread count, share rejection, authorization, difficulty, timeouts, and graceful termination. Recent efforts focused on enabling real RandomX mining, fixing configuration overrides, re-establishing the web UI, and displaying comprehensive mining statistics including accepted and rejected shares.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical, recurring issue: shares found by the Monero (RandomX) miner were consistently being rejected by the  mining pool with an **Unauthenticated** error. This occurred despite a successful Stratum login and handshake, and the mining process itself was active and generating a good hashrate.

This Unauthenticated error resurfaced after significant progress had been made:
1.  **Stratum Protocol Fix**: The core Stratum handshake was initially failing. This was resolved by implementing Monero-specific  methods and improving socket handling in .
2.  **Configuration Consistency**: The backend () was fixed to strictly prioritize pool, wallet, and coin settings from , preventing accidental overrides from the web UI.
3.  **Web Monitoring & Stats**: The  was corrected to send stats to the proper backend URL. Hashrate calculation frequency in  was improved, and the dashboard was displaying accurate, real-time hashrates.
4.  **Rejected Shares**: Backend () was updated to track both  and , feeding this data to the existing frontend UI which already displayed them with ✅ and ❌ icons.

The last actions involved the AI engineer editing  to refine authentication logic and add a periodic keepalive mechanism. A subsequent test run (Chat 417) still showed the 🔐 Authentication issue: Unauthenticated warning, indicating the problem persists. The engineer's immediate plan is to further investigate the wallet format and authentication parameters specific to .
