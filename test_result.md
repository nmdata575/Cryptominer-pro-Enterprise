Key findings: Web interface properly shuts down when miner process terminates, connection refused error indicates server is no longer running, graceful shutdown mechanism working correctly. The status dot disconnected state is handled by the JavaScript setConnected(false) function which adds 'disconnected' class to status-dot element and sets status text to 'Disconnected' when WebSocket connection fails."

    message: "NEW FEATURES TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY: Password option and mining intensity features fully implemented and working correctly. All 12 backend tests passed (100% success rate). Key findings: (1) Password option: --password argument parsing works, configuration file loading includes pool_password field, interactive setup includes password prompt, mining engine uses password for pool authentication. (2) Mining intensity: --intensity argument accepts 0-100 values with validation, configuration includes mining_intensity field, interactive setup includes intensity prompt, mining worker implements proper CPU throttling. (3) Integration: Both features work together, example config includes both fields, help text displays new options correctly. All technical verification requirements met."

    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Mining intensity feature is NOT displayed in web interface. Testing confirmed that while mining intensity (75%) works correctly in terminal output and backend implementation, the web monitoring interface at http://localhost:8080 completely lacks any intensity-related information. The web interface only shows 4 cards (Hashrate, System, Stats, Runtime) but no intensity display. Root cause analysis: (1) Mining engine's get_mining_status() method doesn't include intensity in returned stats, (2) Web interface JavaScript doesn't process or display intensity data, (3) HTML template has no intensity-related elements. This is a missing feature that needs immediate implementation for the web interface to properly display the new mining intensity control feature."
